Make sure your plants have a good amount of organic matter, as well. They greatly benefit from regular applications of fertilizer or a single application of a slow-release fertilizer.Marigolds also perform best in full sun, which will keep tall plants sturdy and help form large, dense, blooms and foliage. In part shade or more, all parts of the plant are more susceptible to fungal diseases, such as powdery mildew. Avoid wetting the foliage, especially later in the day, to help prevent problems with this. Marigolds are also susceptible to spider mites in the dry heat of the summer, so watch for fine webbing and treat with insecticidal soap as needed."

Start them indoors 8 to 10 weeks prior to the frost-free date in your area by sowing seeds directly on top of the soil; they need sunlight to germinate. Keep the soil lightly moist. Seedlings will emerge in 2 to 3 weeks. Divide and plant them in individual pots once their true sets of leaves have emerged over the next few weeks. As soon as the threat of frost has passed, begin to harden off plants. Plant them outside once the seedlings have developed two sets of leaves and a robust root system. Water regularly as browallia doesn't tolerate drought. Pinch back plants to keep them bushy."

The flowering types generally bloom outdoors during the short days of the year in winter hardy plant zones and begin flowering in the fall and continue until spring. They also bloom in cool summer climates. A great bedding plant, plectranthus can be used with flowering plants to add color with their foliage when other plants may not be in bloom.\n\nFor best results, make sure to plant plectranthus in good, well-drained soil. One of the surest ways to kill a plectranthus is overly wet soil or pots that hold too much water. These plants are similar to a succulent and can handle short droughts from time to time. Even when the whole plant wilts, it will generally bounce back quickly when watered again.\nThe species you are growing dictates the amount of sun needed and whether the plant will thrive indoors or outside. While almost all plectranthus can grow in full sun, most will prefer a bit of shade, especially in the afternoon sun. Light foliage varieties, especially gold ones, can sometimes burn in full sun causing unsightly bleached leaves. Some varieties can handle quite a bit of shade, but some of the bright color varieties will tend to \"green out\" with the foliage taking on a green tinge in too much shade. Indoors, most plectranthus will do best in lots of sunlight; a southern exposure ideally yields the brightest color. Many will handle eastern or western exposures, and only the most shade tolerant will thrive in northern windows.\n\nMany varieties of plectranthus are quick growing. To keep them looking nice and tidy, give them an occasional pruning or pinching. For young plants, it is best to pinch off a few leaves just up from the base. This encourages good branching early on and helps create a bushy plant. It is also good to pinch off old flower blooms. This coaxes some of the longer-blooming types to rebloom, and gives all of them a tidier look."

The time to plant Texas Yellow Star is in the fall. The seeds will sprout and make what is called a rosette. This rosette will grow slowly throughout the winter until February then it will grow quickly and begin flowering. It will continue flowering as it grows."

Grow it as an annual plant in all other Zones. When choosing a planting location for tweedia, search for a place that is protected from strong wind. The delicate flowers are easily damaged in heavy gusts and intense rain. A sunny, sheltered corner of a patio or the south or west side of an evergreen shrub often provides excellent shelter for delicate plants.\n\nTweedia grows well in containers, raised beds, and in the ground. Start seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last predicted frost in your area. Provide this short, vining plant support at planting time by placing it at the base of a trellis or teepee. Since it grows only 1  to 3 feet tall, it can benefit from small branches sunk into the ground alongside the plant as extra support. Tweedia can be overwintered indoors. Bring containers indoors in fall before frost and place them in a bright, cool spot."

Generally it will not kill a plant, but will stress it some and slow it down. This is a common problem with the purpletop vervain, especially on lower growth. The best solution for powdery mildew is to plant the plants in a well circulated area, making sure the plants leaves dry out well after a rain or watering. If this has been a problem in the garden in the past, make sure to clean up any old plant debris like dead leaves or stems on the ground. Cleaning up old material is the best prevention and rotating plantings so the same susceptible plants aren't in the same spot each year."

For in-ground plantings, add compost or slow-release fertilizer to keep gorgeous displays going throughout the growing season. For wishbone flower in a container, add fertilizer in either a slow-release formation or by liquid feed on a regular basis. Wishbone flower prefers to be consistently moist, so don't let it dry out between waterings. Don't let the soil get and stay soggy, though, or root rot can become a problem.\n\nOften grown as a shade plant, wishbone flower is tolerant of brighter sun exposures. As long as it is kept evenly moist and watered regularly, it can handle full sun conditions. The ideal growing conditions for this annual are found in part shade with protection from the hot afternoon sun. With full shade, the plant tends to bloom less and appear less dense than its sunnier counterparts. Some older varieties are less tolerant of hot weather.

While this pesky fungus probably won't kill the plants, it does diminish their beauty. The best control method for powdery mildew is prevention; look for resistant zinnia varieties and keep plenty of airflow around the plants.\nLeaf spot and blight are two more common diseases found in zinnias. Similar to powdery mildew, these conditions are caused by fungi. Control methods are the same: Remove any debris from the base of the plants to keep them clean. Many of these fungal diseases are found on the lower leaves of taller zinnia varieties used for cut flowers. Place shorter plants in front of taller zinnias to hide their naked stems.\n\nSaving zinnia seeds is a good way to start next year's plants. Because many zinnias are sold as mixes, you don't have to worry about seedlings being identical to the parent plant. As old flower heads dry, remove spent blooms and harvest the small arrowhead-shape seeds from between each of the petals. Zinnia seeds can be started directly in the ground the following spring."

Water bulbs well after planting and cover the planting spot with a 2-inch layer of mulch, if desired.\n\nAfter blooms fade, the plant's strappy green foliage adds color and texture to the garden for several weeks. The foliage can be removed in early summer after it begins to turn yellow. One of the easiest bulbs to grow, grape hyacinths return for decades, needing to be divided only every 3 to 5 years.

This smell works as an animal deterrent and, coupled with their taste, prevents alliums from being eaten by creatures like pesky rabbits, deer, and other browsing animals. Many gardeners take advantage of this and plant them among other plants to act as a barrier to troublesome critters. Try planting some at the front of garden borders, or surrounding tender lily bulbs. The fact that most alliums are also bulbs also works to their advantage. By storing water and nutrients, these plants are extremely drought tolerant and can survive long dry spells that might kill other plants without the benefit of a storage root."

Older varieties and species tolerate shade, but full sun brings out the best leaf color and flower show. Cannas growing in warm southern climates need a bit of afternoon shade to keep foliage from bleaching. Taller varieties need full sun to prevent flopping, which necessitates staking.\nIn areas where cannas are not winter hardy, they can be stored for the following year.

Daffodil flowers typically follow the sun, so make sure any shade is at the back of the site to get forward-facing flowers. When considering where to plant daffodils, don't overlook the ground beneath the canopy of deciduous trees. Much of daffodils' growth is completed before deciduous trees leaf out in spring, making that ground prime for underplanting. Bulbs there may require additional watering though, because the tree roots can rob the soil of moisture.\n\nPlant daffodils in fall after the soil cools slightly, but before it freezes. As a rule of thumb, each bulb should be planted two to three times as deep as the bulb's diameter (most are planted 4 to 6 inches deep).  Spacing also depends upon bulb size. In general, plant the bulbs 4 to 10 inches apart. Small bulbs can be closer together; large bulbs go farther apart. Don't fret if spacing makes the planting bed look bereft of bulbs; they'll fill in the gaps as they naturalize over the years.\nMake quick work of planting drifts of bulbs by digging a large trench and scattering several bulbs in the planting hole—making sure the pointy ends face up. Cover with soil, then water well to get rid of air pockets. Step back and await an avalanche of color in the spring."

(So don't panic if your plant dies back rather quickly after it blooms—it's just taking a nap.) While the classic poster child of the Dicentra family is the typical old-fashioned bleeding heart, there are other species worth considering, like the fringed bleeding heart (Dicentra eximia). This eastern United States native comes from a shady woodland environment. Similar in many ways to the traditional bleeding heart, fringed bleeding heart comes up in spring and blooms right away. The flowers aren't quite as obviously heart-shaped, but they are no less beautiful. One benefit to the fringed bleeding heart is that it is not an ephemeral, so it stays up in your garden all through the growing season. This also means that you may get a few reblooms in the early summer if it stays cool, and potentially again in the fall as the summer dies down. The foliage on the fringed bleeding heart is smaller and finer than the old-fashioned type."

It doesn't require a well-drained location as many other plants do, making it a wonderful option for wet, boggy areas of your garden. Jack-in-the-pulpits are poisonous, especially the corms (bulblike roots), so exercise caution when planting these if you have pets and/or small children around. To plant, dig a 6-inch-deep hole and place the corm as you would a crocus or other small bulbs, root side down. These are ephemeral plants: Once they have bloomed and stored enough energy for next year, the foliage dies back. Plan to fill bare spots with annuals.\nTo prevent slugs from damaging Jack-in-the-pulpit, place a small bowl or container filled with a few inches of beer near the plants. The slugs can't resist the smell, crawl into the container, and drown. Another way to deter slugs is to keep landscape tidy: Slugs like to spend their days under leaves and other plant debris, where it's nice and moist. Sprinkling diatomaceous earth, eggshells, grit, sand, gravel, and pine needles creates barriers slugs don't want to crawl over to reach your Jack-in-the-pulpit plants, too."

Solid green leaf varieties can handle full sun as long as they don't dry out. Varieties with variegated foliage appreciate part shade to prevent burning their tender foliage. In deep, full shade, some variegated varieties may green up and be less vibrant. The key is to balance the appropriate amount of sun to keep the foliage looking good, while also finding the right amount to encourage the most blossoms. The bloom period of Jacob's ladder is fairly short, so err on the side of keeping the foliage looking its best by focusing on overall plant health.\nLittle additional maintenance is needed to keep these plants looking nice. Deadhead spent blooms to prevent plants from wasting energy on seed production.

Come fall and cooler temperatures, many species of spiderwort will happily begin again, sending up new shoots and sometimes new blooms."

Some types are like succulents and can be treated like a cactus.

This sap is generally poisonous and is what makes the plant deer- and rabbit-resistant. The sap is an irritant to humans as well, so wear gloves when you are handling spurge as it can cause a skin rash. Also, avoid getting the sap in your eyes; it can cause vision problems, even blindness."

The best way to keep forsythias maintained and to conserve their original habit is by selectively pruning out old wood after blooming. Remove any branches that look old and woody at the base of the plant. This will encourage the plant to branch at the base, preventing any erratic new growth from cut stems. If plants are truly out of control or just messy, forsythias can be refreshed with a harsh rejuvenation pruning. This can be done by cutting back the entire shrub to just above ground level. Harsh pruning will encourage the whole plant to re-flush, and can also bring back their old habit if the shrubs had been pruned poorly in the past."

        "description": "Go tropical in a big way with honey bush. The vigorous, ranging shrub has 12-inch-long leaflets that are a pretty blue-green hue and often serrated. Grown in beds and borders in mild climates, honey bush will quickly grow 6-12 feet tall and wide. In cold climates, confine it to a container, where it will create an impressive focal point in short order. Complementing the sculptural foliage, 1-2-foot-tall flower spikes begin red in winter and turn burgundy in early spring. Grow honey bush in full sun or part shade and moist, well-drained soil. It spreads by suckers, so keep an eye on it and remove any unwanted growth as soon as you spot it. Keep plants in top form by cutting them back to ground level in early spring.",

To be safe, test your soil's pH with an inexpensive soil test kit. A pH of 6 or lower is best, but higher pH soils can be acidified with peat moss and sulfur. This shrub is not a heavy feeder and generally doesn't require fertilizing. If you do fertilize, use a plant food that is low in nitrogen and phosphorus (the first two numbers on a fertilizer package) and higher in potassium (the third number on a fertilizer package).\nLeucadendron likes humidity and good air circulation, so plant it in the open and avoid crowding plants together. To avoid foliar diseases, water plants at the base. If overhead watering is the only option, irrigate earlier in the day so foliage can dry before nightfall. Leucadendron is drought-tolerant once the roots have established themselves, but does benefit from a regular, deep watering. Allow the soil to dry somewhat between waterings. Mulch once a year to control weeds and conserve moisture. Deadhead this shrub to keep it tidy. Prune after flowering is done for the season."

If the roots stay wet for too long, it can be prone to rot.\nOleander grows fast and can develop a lanky habit if not properly maintained. One of the best ways to create the densest habit possible is to plant it in full sun, which also encourages the most blossoms. Oleander tolerates part shade, but in those conditions, it requires staking to prevent flopping and will need more frequent pruning. In cool climates where the oleander is not hardy, overwinter potted plants indoors.\n\nUnlike some plants that have one toxic compound, the oleander has several, which can cause issues with the digestive tract and cardiovascular and nervous systems. Most of these compounds are only harmful when eaten, so no part of the oleander should be ingested by humans or animals. Also be careful when pruning an oleander because the milky sap can cause skin irritation.\n"
